An element comprises the starting and ending tags, attributes, any nested tags and textual content. For example in the roll-call example, the `<roll>` tag along with all its sub-structure and content is considered to be an element and similarly the `<question>` tag is a child element of `<roll>`.  Among the child elements of `<roll>`, one might be interested in the string contained in the `<question>` tag. Often such text strings are what we are trying to get at in our web scraping endeavors. The tags and attributes, that encapsulate the content  of interest, serve as machine-readable guides that programmatically lead us to it. Using scripting languages, such as Pythons, we can automate such content extraction across thousands and even more XML documents.\n"

      "Majority of text content on the web is available as HTML web pages. Concepts such as elements, tags, attributes that we saw for XML documents, in the previous section, also apply to HTML documents. However, HTML di\ufb00ers from XML in that it is primarily meant for publishing content to the web rather than as a data exchange format. As a result there is often a lack of strict structure (schema) in HTML web pages. This can make traversing the HTML tag hierarchy from a Python script quite tricky. We will learn some techniques in the workshop which should make this task easier. Secondly, the unstructured nature of HTML documents a\ufb00ects the re-usability of any Python script. For example, even if a script works for one HTML document on a website, it may not fully work with another HTML document that exists at the same level of hierarchy on the website, for example, providing the same data for another year, .\n"
